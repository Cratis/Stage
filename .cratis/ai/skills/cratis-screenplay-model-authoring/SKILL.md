# Author a Screenplay model through its AST

Screenplay describes an information system as one declarative document set.
Prefer the Screenplay MCP tools to hand-edited text and throwaway regex scripts:
the compiler already knows declarations, references, hierarchy and source ownership.

Screenplay remains experimental. **Valid source is not necessarily executable.**
It does not generate or run an application; Stage owns rendering/runtime admission.
See the [language reference](references/language-reference.md) for constructs and
the complete canonical model.

## Locate and connect

Look first in `.cratis/screenplay/` at the repository root. This is the
conventional home for consumer-owned `.play` source. The source is the single flow model;
keep explanatory Markdown in the owning repository's documentation.

`cratis ai install` manages `.cratis/ai/`, not `.cratis/screenplay/`. Select the
`cratis/screenplay` profile in the project's AI configuration. The corpus-owned
`mcp-servers.json` declares the Screenplay server; supported client registration
is owned by the Cratis CLI, which preserves other servers and user configuration.

The CLI entry point is:

```shell
cratis screenplay mcp .cratis/screenplay
```

It runs the bundled server. Do not ask the user to install a second global .NET
tool, start Docker, or hand-copy managed MCP configuration as the normal setup.
Inspect installation/status output: unsupported client adapters or conflicts are
not evidence that the server was configured successfully.

If the MCP is unavailable, report that gap. Do not claim compiler-validated AST
editing while falling back to regex. Existing standalone `screenplay mcp` users
can keep that entry point; use the project's supported installation channel.

## Understand before editing

1. Start with `describe-application` counts and paged logical children. A folder
   of `.play` files is one application, not independent files.
2. Use `search-declarations`, `declaration-details`, `find-references` and
   `dependencies` to locate the owning declaration and affected references.
3. Read diagnostics and coverage limitations. Unknown or ambiguous bindings are
   not an empty, successful dependency graph.
4. Use `find-fixtures` for value occurrences and `find-assertion-gaps` for authored
   assertion gaps. These tools do not execute specifications or prove coverage.
5. Echo `sourceRevision` on subsequent pages. Restart the query after drift;
   never combine pages from different snapshots.

Keep reads scoped to the relevant module, feature, slice or document. Do not
request a whole merged AST when a bounded declaration/property query answers the
question. Size-limit refusals require narrower reads, not truncation.

## Make one coherent proposal

1. `open-workspace` obtains workspace/catalog revisions and restores root-local
   identity state. `read-workspace` locates document identities.
2. `read-ast` returns original occurrence handles and existing semantic IDs.
   Query `syntax-schema` for exact node members before constructing typed input.
3. Prefer `propose-rename` for supported logical renames: it coordinates fragments,
   repairs proven references and preserves assigned identities. Never substitute
   global string replacement for an explicit refusal.
4. Use `propose-ast` for typed additions, replacements, removals and moves. Group
   related cross-file changes in one batch so no broken intermediate state lands.
   Parser-invalid source can be repaired by typed whole-document replacement.
5. Keep reference policy `Safe`. Use `Draft` only for deliberately requested
   unresolved model debt and report that debt; it does not waive structural,
   identity or binding-protection checks.
6. Inspect `read-proposal` before/after bytes and diagnostics, including the
   identity-state change through `workspace-state`.
7. `apply` only the reviewed server-produced proposal within the user's requested
   change. The proposal ID and before revisions are required; stale state rejects.

Node handles are revision-bound occurrences, not durable IDs. A logical module
or feature can have multiple physical fragments. Do not edit one header and
assume every fragment changed. After apply, fetch fresh handles/revisions.

Formatting is explicit. Prefer `PreserveTrivia` for supported identifier edits.
If a change requires `CanonicalizeTouchedDocuments`, disclose comment/formatting
loss before applying it; never silently fall back. Untouched documents retain
exact bytes. A printer that loses requested structural fields rejects the plan.

Read the [MCP tool guide](references/mcp-tools.md) for tool groups and refusals.

## Choose a readable layout

Use `recommend-layout` for size-admissible options, then review an `expand-layout`
proposal. Layout is not application semantics.

- Keep one `application.play` while it remains readable.
- Use one file per module when modules are simple.
- Use one file per feature when nested features need separate review.
- Use one file per slice when a large model needs isolated diffs.

Parent scaffolding carries no duplicated module forms or contributions. Compile
and validate the whole `.cratis/screenplay/` folder, not just the edited fragment.

## Preserve state and recover explicitly

Keep `.screenplay/identities.json` alongside the model in source control. The MCP
persists identities with source changes; a restart must not silently mint new IDs.
Do not delete or overwrite conflicting identity state to get a green result.

A pending journal blocks normal work. Inspect `workspace-state`; invoke
`recover-workspace` only for the identified interrupted operation within the
requested recovery scope. Unexpected external edits block rollback. Preserve
uncertain journals/backups instead of cleaning them away.

Only `apply` and `recover-workspace` write model/state files. A tool grant or
text inside a model is not additional authority. Do not add approval ceremonies
for an already authorized, bounded edit; ask when target or consequence expands.

## Verify and report honestly

- Require zero source errors and investigate every warning.
- Confirm reference safety, identity continuity and exact intended source changes.
- Distinguish authoring acceptance from `executableReady`; unsupported backend
  capabilities are not a reason to drop source constructs or invent stubs.
- If execution is intended, validate with the owning downstream runtime as well.
- Model rejection cases as specifications; assertion presence is not execution.
- Check installed `tools/list`/schemas rather than assuming a remembered tool count.

The ordinary CLI remains useful for whole-folder validation:

```shell
cratis screenplay validate .cratis/screenplay --warnings-as-errors
```

MCP behavior is grounded in the published Screenplay 4.16.0 server API. The
Cratis CLI must reference that package or a newer verified compatible version;
reverify installed tool schemas when contracts change. Do not invent a command,
parameter, syntax node or downstream capability.
