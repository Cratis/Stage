# PDL — complete grammar and diagnostics

Verified against `Documentation/screenplay/projections/grammar.md` and
`Source/DotNET/Screenplay/Parsing/ProjectionParser.cs` at commit `122eee8`.

Three things below were once looser than the published EBNF, because the parser
accepts more than that EBNF described. `Cratis/Screenplay#199` corrected the
reference, so the two now agree:

- `EveryBlock` accepts a bare `automap` as well as `no automap`.
- The braces on a composite key are **optional** — a composite key with and
  without them both compile clean.
- `$causedBy` is a valid expression root.

Against a Screenplay older than that fix the published grammar is the stricter of
the two, and this file is the accurate one.

## Worked examples

### Composite key with event context

```screenplay
projection LineItems => LineItemReadModel
  from LineItemAdded
    key LineItemKey
      OrderId        = orderId
      LineNumber     = lineNumber
      SequenceNumber = $eventContext.sequenceNumber
      CreatedBy      = $causedBy.subject
    Product = productName
```

### Global counter with a literal key

```screenplay
projection SiteStats => SiteStatsReadModel
  from UserLoggedIn key literal "site-stats"
    count TotalLogins
    lastLogin = $eventContext.occurred
```

Every `UserLoggedIn` updates the same instance, whatever its event source.

### System-wide audit with `all` alongside `from`

```screenplay
projection ActivityFeed => ActivityFeedModel
  all
    count totalSystemEvents
    lastActivity = $eventContext.occurred
  from UserRegistered
    recentUsers = name
```

`totalSystemEvents` counts **every** event in the system; `recentUsers` only fills
on `UserRegistered`.

### Children with a join and scoped removal

```screenplay
projection Group => GroupReadModel
  from GroupCreated
    Name = name
  children members identified by userId
    from UserAddedToGroup key userId
      parent groupId
      Role = role
    join User on UserId
      with UserCreated
        no automap
        UserName = name
    remove with UserRemovedFromGroup key userId
      parent groupId
```

### `every` that ignores child activity

```screenplay
projection Group => GroupReadModel
  every
    LastActivity = $eventContext.occurred
    exclude children
  from GroupCreated
    Name = name
  children members identified by userId
    from UserAdded
      Name = userName
```

Group-level events bump `LastActivity`; member events do not.

### Nested nullable object

```screenplay
projection Slice => SliceReadModel
  from SliceCreated
    Name = name
  nested command
    from CommandSetForSlice
      Name   = commandName
      Schema = schema
    from CommandRenamed
      Name = newName
    clear with CommandClearedForSlice
```

`command` is null until `CommandSetForSlice`, updated in place by
`CommandRenamed`, and set back to null by `CommandClearedForSlice`.

### Several projections in one slice

```screenplay
slice StateView CustomerPortalReport
  query GetPortalReport => PortalReportReadModel
    by customerId CustomerId
  projection PortalReport => PortalReportReadModel
    from PortalInvitationSent
      invitedAt = $eventContext.occurred
  projection RevokedPortalToken => RevokedPortalTokenReadModel
    from PortalTokenRevoked
      revokedAt = $eventContext.occurred
```

Two read models, one behavior. Splitting them across two slices would say the
system has two behaviors where it has one.
