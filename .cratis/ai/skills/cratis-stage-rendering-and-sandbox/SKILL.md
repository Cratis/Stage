description: "What Cratis Stage and `cratis render` actually do with a Screenplay `.play` model today: the narrow model shape Stage 4.24 admits and refuses (STAGE-ESM-*), what it emits (C# Arc/Chronicle backend, React/Vite scaffold, Debug specifications), managed publication, `--force` and recovery, the unmanaged `Customizations/` seam, and the `cratis/stage` sandbox and `cratis/stage-specrunner` job. Use when deciding whether Stage can render a model, reading a blocked render, re-rendering safely, or running the sandbox. Not for: authoring the model (use `cratis-screenplay-model-authoring`) or the render and gap-fill workflow (use `cratis-screenplay-render-and-gap-fill`)."

# What Stage renders, and what it refuses

Stage turns a Screenplay `.play` model into a Cratis Arc + Chronicle application. It
ships a **renderer** (a .NET library, driven from a terminal by `cratis render`), a
disposable **sandbox** container (`cratis/stage`, started by `cratis run`) and a
**specification runner** container (`cratis/stage-specrunner`).

Stage is experimental and its admitted model shape is small. A model it cannot render
exactly produces **no artifacts at all**, never thinner ones. Read the admission rules
before promising that a model can be rendered, and render it to find out: the source
reading in this skill is not a render result.

## Verified product sources

| Source | Pin | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stage | `v4.24.0` (`fa48546`) | Renderer, sandbox host, spec runner; pins Screenplay 4.60.0 |
| cratis CLI | `v3.27.1` (`a327e89`) | `cratis render`, `cratis run`; bundles Stage 4.24.0 and Screenplay 4.60.1 |
| Rendered applications | Arc `22.25.0`, Chronicle `19.8.1`, .NET 10 | The scaffold profile; frontend Components 4.14.0, Scene 4.2.0 |

Everything below was read at those tags (`Source/Rendering.Cratis/**`, `README.md`,
`Documentation/**` in Stage; `Source/Cli/Commands/Render/**` and
`Documentation/reference/screenplay.md` in the CLI), and the vertical in
[references/render-example.md](references/render-example.md) was rendered, built and
tested with cratis 3.27.1. The full version table (Screenplay 4.64.0, Arc 22.50.5,
Chronicle 19.32.0 and the tool split) is in the `cratis-screenplay-toolchain` skill,
`references/versions.md`. Rendered apps are on Arc 22.25.0, so `[ProtectedDecision]`
(Arc 22.39.0 and later) is not available in code written into one.

## Model-first rule

The `.play` model is the source of truth; Stage-managed output is derived from it.

- Change the model, then render again. Never edit a file listed in `.cratis-render.json`:
  the next render replaces it or refuses.
- Hand-written code goes in `Customizations/` (unmanaged), in a separate project, or in
  an explicitly authorized gap-fill for scope Stage cannot render (`cratis-screenplay-render-and-gap-fill`).
- A customization never makes a rejected model renderable, and never weakens modeled
  authorization, validation or `@pii` to get past a refusal.
- Never claim a whole-application result from a subset of the model.

## Rendering with `cratis render`

```bash
cratis render ./model --name Marina --destination ./out
cratis render --workspace ./application.workspace.json --destination ./out
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[PATH]` | A `.play` file or a folder (all `**/*.play`, one application). Defaults to the current directory; exclusive with `--workspace` |
| `--workspace <FILE>` | Canonical workspace envelope (Screenplay MCP `export-workspace`, at most 32 MiB). Keeps its application name and identities |
| `--name <NAME>` | **Required for plain source**, a C# identifier; sets the application identity (Chronicle event store, MongoDB database). With `--workspace` optional, and it must equal the workspace name |
| `--destination <DIR>` | Publication directory, default `./out`. It never defines identity |
| `--target` | Only `cratis` is bundled |
| `--project-name`, `--root-namespace` | Rendering overrides (dot-separated C# identifiers); do not change identity |
| `--force` | See "Publication and recovery" |

Order of events: recover any interrupted earlier publication, compile, bind, build the
execution plan, plan the target (Stage admission), validate artifacts, then publish.
Exit `0` is a published render, `5` is a refusal with nothing published (diagnostics are
printed), `1` is a missing input. Add `-o json` for the counts and the publication
receipt.

Facts that surprise:

- **Binding uses the CLI's bundled Screenplay 4.60.1** (ESM up to v5), not the standalone
  4.64.0 tool. Anything above ESM v5 (v6 constructs) fails binding first; a model that
  binds only on the standalone tool is not renderable.
- **Render never builds, tests or runs** the output. A published render is admission and
  publication only; build and tests are separate results (see "Verify"). Admission can be
  green while a rendered Debug test fails (the example hit this with a query assertion).
- **Implementation attachments are read from the model root**: the folder, or the single
  file's parent directory. Use a dedicated model folder. A required body that is missing
  or changed blocks the render with `STAGE-ESM-020`. A workspace envelope has no
  attachment root, so `file` references there fail the same way.
- `cratis render` and `cratis screenplay validate` are different gates: a model can
  validate and still refuse here.

## What Stage 4.24 admits

Whole-model admission needs ESM schema v1 to v3; anything else is `STAGE-ESM-016`. Event
generations (v4) also fail the CLI pre-check `CLI-RENDER-003`. The admitted vertical:

- concepts, composite types, collections and optional values;
- `StateChange` slices with exactly one command and an unconditional `produces` whose
  `for` is the command identifier, with portable validation;
- `StateView` slices with exactly one projection (or reducer) per read model: a flat
  `from` block, or a scoped projection (several `from`, `remove with`, root `join`,
  one-level `children`, `nested`), keyed by the event source or an event property; and
  any number of optional snapshot queries by the read-model identifier;
- declarative authorization (including query authorization) that requires authentication;
- unique constraints, and modeled specifications that fit the shapes in the reference;
- reducers whose bodies pass the **pure** allowlist (Roslyn analysis).

Not rendered: `Automation` and `Translate` slices (Stage#79, open: the whole automation
is gap-fill), reactions and captures, list, observable, filtered and scoped queries,
`produces when`, command `handler`s, code validation and opaque policies (they refuse),
composite-key projections, `all`, and compliance attributes (`@pii`, `@sensitive`, which
already fail binding with `PLAY0268`). Any one blocking diagnostic fails the whole plan.
A refusal is not a licence to weaken the model: drop no specification, event generation
or protection to get a render; keep the model, record the capability gap and gap-fill.
The code table, the projection and specification rules and three refusals reproduced while
building the example are in [references/admission.md](references/admission.md); the exhaustive ledger
is `references/renderable-subset.md` in `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`.

Descriptions and documentation are never rendered, so a rule that exists only in prose
is not enforced in the generated code.

## What it emits

At application scope the plan holds the scaffold plus the modeled artifacts, for the
example 30 files: a `.csproj` and `.slnx`, `Program.cs`, `appsettings.json`,
`docker-compose.yml`, the Directory props files, a policy registration and generated
policies, `Common/<Concept>.cs`, one `<Module>/<Feature>/<Slice>/` folder per slice with
the `[Command]` record and `Handle()`, the `[EventType]` event, the validator and the
`[ReadModel]` with its query, `scene.json`, and a React/Vite frontend scaffold
(`.frontend/`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`). Per-file detail, the
scaffold pins and the `Customizations/` contract are in
[references/rendered-application.md](references/rendered-application.md).

Modeled specifications become xunit classes compiled in **Debug only**
(`IsTestProject` when Debug): a command spec `when_<snake>` in namespace
`<slice namespace>.when_<snake>` (so `when_x.when_x`), queries `when_<snake>_is_queried`,
read models `when_<snake>_is_projected`.

## Publication and recovery

Ownership is the destination's **`.cratis-render.json`** manifest (semantic revision,
identity, path and SHA-256 per artifact); there are no in-file markers. Interrupted
commits are journaled in the **`.cratis-render/`** control directory (journal, staging,
backups). Never stage `.cratis-render/` in git; commit the manifest with the output.

- An unmanaged file at a planned path is refused, even with `--force`.
- A user-modified managed file is refused unless it is still active **and** `--force` is
  given; `--force` replaces it. It never overwrites unmanaged files and never deletes a
  modified stale file. A stale managed file is removed only if its bytes still match.
- Recovery runs before planning, even when planning then fails. **`recovered: true` in the
  result means stop and reconcile**: the receipt does not describe what recovery changed.
- An unchanged re-render writes nothing (`unchanged` equals the artifact count).
- Use exclusive access to the destination; a receipt is a filesystem result, not a Git
  commit, and the command creates no branch, commit or PR.
- Drift: compare successive manifests' `semanticRevision` for renders with the same
  `--name` and inputs. Do not compare the MCP `modelRevision` with the manifest: their
  application identities can differ.

## Sandbox and specification runner

`cratis run [PATH]` (Docker required) starts `cratis/stage` on the folder or file: Stage
API on `9090`, Chronicle Workbench on `https://localhost:35000`. It is a **partial,
disposable runtime**, not a generated application. The default engine appends modeled
`produces` facts and echoes the payload but enforces no modeled validation or
authorization and no query authorization; `Stage__Runtime__Engine=semantic` opts in to
an engine that does, and refuses what it cannot execute (HTTP 501). Callers are built
from unsigned headers, so authorization there is not a security boundary.

`cratis/stage-specrunner` checks modeled specifications and writes a results file. The
default `structural` engine is deprecated and model-level only; `--engine semantic`
executes admitted specs through Arc's in-memory pipeline and reports `Passed`, `Failed`,
`Unsupported` or `Cancelled`. A green result is Stage semantic-engine evidence: not V4 and not a rendered Debug test run. Commands,
the semantic report schema and limits: [references/sandbox-and-specrunner.md](references/sandbox-and-specrunner.md).

## Verify

- `cratis render` exits 0 and reports `recovered: false`, with `written + unchanged`
  equal to the artifact count; otherwise the render is not a result.
- Report V5 as separate results, each a result or "not run": admission, publication,
  Debug build (`dotnet build <destination>/<Project>.csproj -c Debug`), Debug tests
  (`dotnet test` on the same project) and runtime. Render alone is the first two.
- A refusal is kept verbatim as reported: `PLAY*` (compile or bind), `PLAN-*` (execution
  plan), `STAGE-*` (admission), `CLI-RENDER-*`, or a plain ownership error for a managed
  file. The fix is an intent-preserving model change or a recorded gap, never an edit of
  managed output and never a weakened model.
- No file under `.cratis-render/` is staged; managed files carry no local edits.
- No claim that Stage reviewed, staged or approved anything; its plan is deterministic
  (same input, same bytes and hashes), which is not a review.
- Sandbox expectations account for unenforced validation, authorization and query
  authorization on the default engine.

## Route near misses

- Writing or checking the `.play` model: `cratis-screenplay-model-authoring` (compiler and
  MCP), `cratis-screenplay-event-modeling` (method), and the per-surface
  `cratis-screenplay-*` skills.
- Which tool says what, versions and diagnostics: `cratis-screenplay-toolchain`.
- Running the render workflow end to end, gap-fill and the field ledger:
  `cratis-screenplay-render-and-gap-fill`.
- Understanding the generated command, validator or read model as C#: `cratis-arc-command`
  and `cratis-chronicle-read-model`; checking hand-written code against its slice:
  `cratis-application-slice-conformance`.
- Inspecting the Chronicle store the sandbox writes into: `cratis-chronicle-cli-operations`
  and `cratis-chronicle-web-workbench`.

## Legacy direct-write rendering

The syntax-based `IRenderer` and the optional `Cratis.Stage.Rendering.Cratis.Scaffolding`
package write directly to disk, with no managed staging and no safe stale-file removal; a
failure can leave the target unsafe and incomplete. They are legacy compatibility only.
Use `cratis render` (journaled, recoverable publication) instead.

## Lineage

Rewritten for #493. The earlier version described Stage 3.15.1 (no CLI, eight-file
backend scaffold, `not empty`-only validation, no frontend, Arc 22.3.0); each claim was
re-verified at Stage 4.24.0 and cli 3.27.1 and replaced. See
[references/admission.md](references/admission.md) for source disagreements.
